# Welcome to my testing lab

Here you can find all sorts of programs I have made for testing purposes. 
Feel free to use any of this code for your own needs!

# Index

### `google_revimgsrch.js`: This program can be used to scrape reverse image results from google's api. All you need to do is put the image link in the  `image_url` quotes and your api key in the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY` and run it. Simple and effective. All the results will be printed into the terminal and links are provided too.
The link to get the api key can be found by running the program after downloading with `node google_revimgsrch.js`

### `fork_bomb.sh`: Absolute destruction

### `destruction1.sh`: Run this at your own risk

### `game1.py`: A tkinter game/program where you can draw on a canvas with different colours

### `game2.py`: Same as game1 I think

### `portscanner.py`: A port scanning application built in python

### `arpscanner.py`: A arp (network device discovery) scanner application built in python using scapy (works now)

### `nmapwrapper.py`: A nmap wrapper built in shell script (bash)
